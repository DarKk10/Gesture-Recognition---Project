# Gesture Recognition Using Deep Learning
This project focuses on building a deep learning-based system to recognize human gestures from video or image input, enabling intuitive interaction for applications like Smart TVs, VR/AR interfaces, and more
## 🧠 Project Overview
In this project, I developed a deep learning model that accurately classifies different human gestures. The model was trained on a curated dataset of hand gestures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and advanced data augmentation techniques to improve generalization
## 📚 Features
- Real-time gesture recognition
- Deep learning-based (CNN / 3D CNN / LSTM, depending on the version)
- High accuracy on validation data
- Scalable to additional gesture classes
- Easily integrable with applications like smart devices and games
 ## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV (for image/video processing)
- NumPy, Pandas (for data handling)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
## 📂 Dataset
The model is trained on a gesture dataset consisting of labeled gesture images/videos.
